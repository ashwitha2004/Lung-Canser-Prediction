# 🚀 Lung Cancer Prediction

<div align="center">


**An AI-powered web application for predicting lung cancer risk based on user-provided health and lifestyle data.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

The "Lung Cancer Prediction" project aims to provide an accessible and user-friendly web application for individuals to assess their potential risk of lung cancer. Leveraging machine learning models, the application takes various health and lifestyle factors as input from the user and outputs a prediction regarding their susceptibility to lung cancer. This tool serves as an initial screening aid, empowering users to be more informed about their health and encouraging early consultation with healthcare professionals if a higher risk is indicated.

## ✨ Features

-   **Risk Prediction Engine**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict lung cancer risk.
-   **Interactive Data Input Form**: Allows users to input relevant health, demographic, and lifestyle information.
-   **Intuitive Results Display**: Presents prediction outcomes clearly, making them easy to understand.
-   **Web-Based Interface**: Accessible via a browser, powered by the Django framework.
-   **SQLite Database**: Manages application data efficiently.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites
-   **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashwitha2004/Lung-Canser-Prediction.git
    cd Lung-Canser-Prediction
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Database setup**
    Apply database migrations to create the necessary tables.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
    *Note: The `database.txt` file exists but its contents are not provided. If it contains SQL commands or specific database instructions, they would be applied here.*

5.  **Start development server**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    For Windows users, you can also use the provided batch script:
    ```bash
    run.bat
    ```

6.  **Open your browser**
    Visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
This project does not explicitly use an `.env.example` file. However, for production deployments, you would typically set the `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG` variables in your Django `settings.py` via environment variables.

### Configuration Files
-   `LungApp/settings.py`: Main Django settings for the project, including database configuration (SQLite is default), installed apps, static files, etc.
-   `LungApp/urls.py`: Defines the URL routing for the entire Django project.
-   `Lung/models.py`: Defines the database models for the `Lung` application.
-   `Lung/views.py`: Contains the logic for different web pages/endpoints, including data processing and ML model interaction.

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts
-   `python manage.py runserver`: Starts the Django development server.
-   `python manage.py migrate`: Applies database migrations.
-   `python manage.py makemigrations [app_name]`: Creates new database migrations based on model changes.
-   `pip install -r requirements.txt`: Installs all required Python packages.
-   `run.bat`: (Windows only) A convenience script to execute `python manage.py runserver`.

## 📚 API Reference (Application Endpoints)

While this is primarily a web application with a form-based interface, the underlying Django views act as endpoints.

### Main Endpoints
-   `/`: The home page of the application, likely presenting an overview or the prediction form.
-   `/predict/` (assumed): An endpoint that accepts user input (likely via a POST request from the form) and returns the prediction result.
    -   **Method**: `POST` (for submission), `GET` (for initial form display)
    -   **Payload**: User health/lifestyle data (e.g., age, gender, smoking habits, etc.)
    -   **Response**: Predicted risk of lung cancer.
